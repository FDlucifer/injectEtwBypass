## Build (Only tested from macOS at the moment)
1. Run the compile-x64.sh shell script after installling required dependencies
```bash
# Install brew on macOS if you need it (https://brew.sh/)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# Install Ming using Brew
brew install mingw-w64
# Clone this Reflective DLL project from this github repo
git clone https://github.com/boku7/CobaltStrikeReflectiveLoader.git
# Compile the ReflectiveLoader Object file
cd CobaltStrikeReflectiveLoader/
cat compile.sh
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -m64 -mwindows -c injectEtwBypass.c -o injectEtwBypass.o -masm=intel -Wall -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -nostdlib -fno-ident -Wl,-Tlinker.ld,--no-seh
bash compile.sh
```
